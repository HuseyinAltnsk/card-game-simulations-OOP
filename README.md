# Card Game Simulations


This project makes use of important OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction. 
The games are implemented with probabilities that are relatively close to actual ones, with the addition of an optimized
smart auto-player. We aimed to maximize the victories of this computerized player when n number of games were run.  
Below are the result for 1000 matches for each game:

Crazy 8s:  
410 victories (41.0%)  
Irish Switch:  
458 victories (45.8%)  
Black Jack:  
378 victories (37.8%)  

which prove a great amount of success!
